# Fair-Resource-Sharing-in-Virtual-Cloud-Servers
This project implements a fair resource allocation system for cloud environments using cooperative game theory (Shapley value). It ensures equitable distribution of limited resources (CPU, memory, etc.) among virtual machines (VMs) with varying demands, preventing large VMs from monopolizing resources while protecting smaller ones from starvation.
